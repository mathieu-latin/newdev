Hi there!

You'll find here a little piece of web shop and we'd like you to improve it.

Once you're done, you can do a pull request or sending us an e-mail if you value
the privacy of your participation.

Thanks.


# What you don't have to change

The database schema is fine as is, really, don't bother improving it.

We don't expect you to be an expert, neither a designer so don't do stuff you're
unsure about. Being overconfident isn't always good.


# What you can change, improve, etc.

Mostly everything:

* security
* performance
* design
* existing bugs (known or unknown)
* â€¦


# What we want you to do

* to keep a very simple changelog of what you did (see CHANGELOG)
* to fill anything you'd like to do but it takes too much time into TODO


# Stuffs used

* RedBean for the ORM part: http://www.redbeanphp.com/
* The standard PSR-0 autoloader: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md
